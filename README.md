# CheapShark

CheapShark is an Arduino-based project that leverages the ESP32 to interface with the CheapShark API. This project allows users to retrieve game deals and price information from the CheapShark service directly through an ESP32 microcontroller.

## Features
- Connect to the CheapShark API using ESP32.
- Retrieve and display game deals and price information.
- Simple and easy-to-use implementation for gaming enthusiasts.

## Requirements
- ESP32 Development Board
- Arduino IDE
- Wi-Fi connection

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/LucaIanos/Proiect-CheapShark.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Arduino IDE.
3. Install necessary libraries:
    - WiFi.h
    - HTTPClient.h
4. Upload the code to your ESP32 board.
